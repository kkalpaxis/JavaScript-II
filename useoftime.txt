Hi, Brandon. I'm having a lot of trouble getting used to this concept so I don't know how much I'll be able to finish of the project.
Here is a time log so you get an idea of what I've done today.
Time Log:
3:00-4:00 Review TK examples and videos (again!)
4:00-5:00 Read and take notes on other resources (in notes.txt file)
5:00-6:00
6:00-7:00
