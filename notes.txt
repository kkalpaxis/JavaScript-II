Callbacks Lambda Exlplanation:

- callback functions are functions passed into other functions as arguments
- example 1: const functionFeeder = function(callback) {
  callback('Hello from the inside of Function Feeder');
};
    - here, we defined functionFeeder as the function and gave it a paramter called "callback"
    - this means that when we invoke functionFeeder we can give it another function as an argument (that's why between the curly brackets 
    it says "callback")
    - in this example the function that we call will feed the string 'Hello from the inside' to the callback function we want to use
- example 1 extended: functionFeeder((string) => { // invoking the function
  alert(string); // alert a function that pops up a box in the browser.
});
    - in this situation we are telling functionFeeder to alert (this is also a Javascript command!) the string we give it
    - the "functionFeeder(string)" is what we use to invoke the function
- example 2:  function sayHello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }
    - because we want to use this function over and over again, it is appropriate to use the callback method
- example 2 extended:  function callSayHelloWithLars(callback) {
    const innerName = 'Lars';
    callback(innerName);
  }
    - here we made a new function that allowed us to use the first function again
    - I'm not sure why the callback is in parentheses... is this just for the example or a coding standard?
- example 2 extended: callSayHelloWithLars(sayHello);
    - to finish, we need to invoke the function so it can perform the callback 

Example 3 Lambda: 
- setup: const elements = ['earth', 'wind', 'fire', 'water'];

- "create a function that passes back the first item in an array":
function showFirst(array, callback) {
  callback(array[0]);
}
showFirst(elements, (firstItem) => {
  alert(firstItem);
});

- is this it? how do I call the function? what goes in the paramters?
